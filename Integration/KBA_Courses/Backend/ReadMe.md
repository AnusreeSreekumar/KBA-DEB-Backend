First step to start inorder to start a Java project in backend

npm init (//npm => Node Project Manager)

to make the backend programming more easy for a developer, we use a library called Express. It is a framework/library.

npm i/install express (//to install above framework)

When we do this we get a library folder with lot of files which are needed for program processing in our machine but not required to be pushed to public platform like Git. Inorder to remove these files when pushing to git repo we create another file as ".gitignore" and write the respective file name in that. Then git will automaticlly ignore this libraries when doing a commit.
